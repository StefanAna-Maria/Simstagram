<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>Welcome to SimsTagram! We know this isn't the most exciting page on the site — and honestly, if you’re reading this, we probably deserve a 10 just for the effort.</p>

<h2>1. What We Collect</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Your email address (for login and notifications)</li>
    <li>Your display name and profile picture</li>
    <li>Posts, comments, photos, messages, and friend connections</li>
    <li>IP and device info (standard stuff, mostly for security)</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. What We Don’t Do</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We don’t sell your data.</li>
    <li>We don’t stalk your messages (not even the cringy ones).</li>
    <li>We don’t allow third parties to bombard you with ads.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. What We Might Use</h2>
<p>We might use your data to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Help you connect with friends</li>
    <li>Keep the platform safe and friendly</li>
    <li>Improve features (based on usage trends)</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Security</h2>
<p>We do our best to keep your data secure. Still, remember to use a strong password. Preferably something better than "password123".</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>Your data is stored securely and only for as long as necessary. If you delete your account, we’ll wipe everything (including that embarrassing post from 3 months ago).</p>

<h2>6. Cookies 🍪</h2>
<p>We’d love to say we use cookies... but we haven’t baked that feature yet. So for now, the only cookies you’ll find are in your kitchen, not on this site.</p>

<h2>7. Final Words</h2>
<p>This policy may be updated occasionally, but let’s be real: no one reads these anyway. If you did, congrats — you officially qualify for a 10 just for making it this far.</p>
